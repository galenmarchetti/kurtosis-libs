## TBD
* Created example test suite to validate that the client library work
* Bugfix in volume-writing location, and force pretty formatting on written logs
* Made the existing test actually query the node it created
* Added another test to demonstrate an initial network setup
* Adding copyright headers
* Renamed tests to have more descriptive names
* When asked about test suite data, send back a JSON of test suite metadata (rather than just a list of test names)
* Made log level configurable
