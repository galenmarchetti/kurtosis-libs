My Kurtosis Testsuite
=====================
Welcome to your new Kurtosis testsuite skeleton! To get started:

1. Modify the files within the `example_impl` as you see fit
2. Run `scripts/build_and_run.sh all` to run your test suite with the latest version of Kurtosis

Some helpful tips:
* `build_and_run.sh` can be run with the `build` argument to just build, or `run` to just run
