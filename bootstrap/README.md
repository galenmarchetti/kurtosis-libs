My Kurtosis Testsuite
=====================
Welcome to your new Kurtosis testsuite skeleton! To get started:

1. Run `git init` to initialize this directory as a Git repo
1. Run `go get github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go` to pull the Go client lib
1. Using the documentation on [the Kurtosis docs](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-docs), modify the files within the `example_impl` in order to build a testsuite for your use case
1. Run `scripts/build_and_run.sh all` to build and run your test suite with the latest version of Kurtosis

Some helpful tips:
* `build_and_run.sh` can be run with the `build` argument to just build, or `run` to just run
